# SuperMath
I'll be honest, this program is not intuitive at all. It's not finished, and it can't even compete with a regular calculator. But if you're feeling really patient, go ahead and give it a try.

***THIS PROGRAM ONLY WORKS ON WINDOWS***

So the program will run, and the first thing you'll see is a window that reads a mini welcome message, the program's version, a very brief description of the update, and a prompt asking you for input. In the input bar you can enter (for now) only two arguments: pythagorean theorem (PT), and basic arithmetic (BA). Should you enter "PT", you will be asked to enter the type of triangle you are trying to find, followed by the numbers. On the other hand, if you enter "BA", you will be asked to enter 2 values. After, you will be asked to enter an operation for the script to do. Since this is not intuitive at all, I'll break it down here.

Addition = "addition"
Subtraction = "subtraction"
Multiplication = "multiplication"
Division = "division"
Greatest Common Denominator/Factor/Divisor = "gcd"
Least Common Multiple = "lcm"
Exponent = "power"
Root = "root"

**Please Note: When selecting Exponent or Root, the script will use the values in the following way: Value 1 = 2, Value 2 = 4. Exponent: 2^4. In root, the first value will be rooted by the second value.**
